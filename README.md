  *** No Mobile Implementation ***
  (It's still slightly usable, but if you want to demo it effeciently, use a desktop)

# How To Launch:
  
 1. Go to the Environments section on this page. if you're on desktop it's on your right, if you're on mobile, scroll down.
 2. Click github-pages
 3. Click View Deployment


# How To Use:

 1. Click on the text to directly edit it.
 2. Click the edit tool to add or delete sections (deletable sections are experience and education).
 3. Click Finished Editing to see how it looks.
 4. To re-edit and see the edit tool, reclick on any of the sections.


# Key Features:

 - Using class components from react, you can directly click on a section in the cv, it will turn it into forms for you to alter the text.
 - Forms and Headers are relatively in the same spot when you click on them, making inputting text and knowing where it will be cohesive.
 - Edit tool to add sections to the CV (ex: you have 4 jobs you want to put on it).
 - Edit tool can change positions, making it easier to manipulate fields if you feel like it is in the way. (I don't think it will be, but the features there).
 - DaisyUI is used for color themes and button pairing.

Created using React, Tailwind, and DaisyUI.
